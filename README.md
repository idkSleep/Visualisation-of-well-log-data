# Well Log Dataset

## Content
This dataset contains a well log file with approximately 8,000 lines of data. The data includes measurements of:

- **Resistivity**
- **Spontaneous Potential**
- **Gamma Ray**
- **Bulk Density**
- **Neutron Porosity**
- **Density Porosity**

The dataset is ideal for experimentation and training small deep learning models. These models can then be fine-tuned and transferred to larger datasets for more advanced applications.
