# Visualisation of Well Log Data
## Content
This dataset contains a well log file with approximately 8,000 lines of data. The data includes measurements of:

- **Resistivity**
- **Spontaneous Potential**
- **Gamma Ray**
- **Bulk Density**
- **Neutron Porosity**
- **Density Porosity**

The dataset is ideal for experimentation and learning of use of different available libraries in Python to visaualise this data and gain crucial insights.
